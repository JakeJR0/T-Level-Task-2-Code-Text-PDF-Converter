## Introduction

This is a simple program to automate the process of converting code to different formats, within the exams each student has to submit a PDF and a text file of each format, to make this more efficient, I have made this program to automate the process.

## How to use

- Download the program
- Add the following folders to the directory of the program
  - `CODE`
  - `PDF`
  - `TEXT`
  - `OUTPUT`
- Add your code to the `CODE` folder (You don't have to worry about the code being in folders, the program will automatically find the code files)
- Run the `main.py` file
- Answer the questions in the terminal
- The program will automatically convert the code to PDF and text and save it in the `OUTPUT` folder as a zip file, it will also save the PDF and text files in the `PDF` and `TEXT` folders
